RRR description:

divide bitvector into fixed-size blocks
usually b (size) = log(n) / 2 bits (this is the optimal value)

for each block store:
  - the # of 1's (class)
  - the position of 1's (offset)
      - the offset is the index of the current block in the list of possible
      combinations of patterns with the given block size and class
      - ex. 1 0 1 1
      - 4 bits has C(4,3)

superblocks which are blocks of blocks can be used to accelerate rank
queries.
  - each superblock contains the total number of 1s of the blocks inside it
  - so if you were to compute `rank(i)`, instead of having to go through
  each of the blocks up to `i`, you would only need to sum up all the
  "superblocks" until `i`, then go through the block which contains `i`

for efficient operations, we'll want to consider the CPU's word size. (for
64 bit cpus, this would be 64 bits) This means that the practical upper limit
for block size b is defined as:

b = min(log(n)/2, 64)

this also indicates that our max size bitvector n is given by:
log(n)/2 = 64
n = 10^128

which should frankly be plenty, so we don't need to worry about reaching the
maximum block size.

/*
Blocks:

block configurations can vary based on block size:
- b <= 8
	- 3 bits for class
- b <= 4
	- 2 bits for class

`log_2(C(b, class))` bits for offset.
so `C(4, 3)` for b=4 and class=3 would yield `log_2(4)` which is `2`

the most amount of memory an offset field could take is 7 bits
that is the result of `ceil(log_2(C(8, 4)))`.

block is encoded as follows:
- class (some bits)
- offset (some bits)
